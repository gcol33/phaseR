Description: A framework for analysing change in longitudinal data that
    treats "before" and "after" as regimes, not time points. Separates
    regime activation from regime-specific dynamics, preventing
    outcome-dependent stratification and enabling valid counterfactual
    inference. Applicable to ecology, epidemiology, economics, psychology,
    medicine, and any field with latent phase transitions.
